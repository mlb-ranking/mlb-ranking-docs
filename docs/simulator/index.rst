Simulator Application 
=====================
Application that utilizes the collected data and computes predictions based on a variety of algorithms and formulas. 

Team Simulator
--------------
The simulator allows the user to use different stats to predict which teams will be successful in certain year ranges.

Simulation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Team Status (Conservative, Win Now, Rebuild)
* Factors of importance on stats (suggest values by default)
* Use the player simulator to predict how players will progress

Player Simulator
----------------
The player simulator will use big data philosophies such as the jaccard similarity to find patterns among other players to help predict the future of a player.

Simulation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Look at age, height, weight, and position as base factors
* Determine which stats best predict a players future. Similar to how MIT noted the correleation of run differential to wins
